            <h2>Importance of Voting</h2>
            <p>
                Voting is crucial because it empowers citizens to voice their opinions and influence
                government actions. It is a way to hold elected officials accountable and ensure that
                they represent the interests of their constituents. By voting, individuals contribute to
                shaping the policies that govern their society, including education, healthcare, and public safety.
